OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT:
Project Objective
The goal of your project seems to involve analyzing and visualizing customer data to gain insights into demographics, spending behavior, and product preferences. Key areas of focus include:

Exploring relationships between demographic factors (e.g., age, gender) and income or spending patterns.
Investigating purchasing trends by product type and demographic group.
Presenting findings with clear visualizations like histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps.
Steps Undertaken
Data Cleaning:

Identified and resolved missing values:
Numeric columns (Age, Spending_Score, etc.) filled with the mean.
Categorical columns (Gender, City) filled with the mode.
Rows with missing ID dropped.
Ensured consistent formatting (e.g., integer formatting in plots).
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Histogram: Visualized the distribution of Age and Annual_Income.
Scatter Plot: Explored the relationship between Age and Annual_Income.
Heatmap: Examined the relationship between Gender and Product_Purchased.
Visualization Enhancements:

Adjusted ticks and labels for readability.
Applied colormaps and dynamic scaling to improve interpretability.
Libraries and Tools
Data Manipulation:

Pandas: For data cleaning, exploration, and preprocessing.
NumPy: For numerical operations and handling arrays.
Data Visualization:

Matplotlib: For creating histograms, scatter plots, and customizing visualizations.
Seaborn: For advanced, aesthetically pleasing visualizations (e.g., heatmaps).
Data Analysis:

Scipy/Statsmodels (optional): For statistical analysis if needed.
Scikit-learn (optional): For clustering or predictive analysis (e.g., K-Means, Linear Regression).
